      <p class="description margin-bottom-36">Mr. Steil has a passion for making his own beers <br>from his warehouse in Germany in 1963. </p><br>

        <h3>Allow us to tell you a story...</h3>
        <p>Dreaming to create his own distillery, he brewed different kinds of draft beers at a young age and crafted his beers with experience. He worked on his lifetime passion while also working to provide for his family as a laborer to a nearby store. </p>

        <p>Mr. Steil worked for 12hrs in the store to support his family and his passion for creating beers and after a long day of work, at night, he spent his night mixing and fermenting his ingredients in his warehouse. All of the work hoping that one day he can stop working on the store and build his own name for his passion with beers. </p>

        <p>But doors for opportunities is getting past Mr. Steil day by day, his days standing at the store grew longer taking away all his energy left to work on his passion. He still tried to work his way but even with all his heart, he cannot mix the right beer. The flavor that he believed would be the name for his company. So his motivation faded. </p>

        <p>Dragged by responsibilities, he continued to stand daily at the store with his feet sore and heart broken. He went home one day, poured the remaining draft beer he made on his big mug in his right hand. He sat on his chair and held on his other hand the only comfort he had for the past year after standing daily at the store: his foot powder. </p>

        <p>Half asleep while in front of the tv, he poured the bottle he was holding from his left hand in his mouth only to figure that it was his foot powder! He jumps frantically, does not know what to do and the only thing that could save him from taking it off his mouth is the draft beer he is holding. Having nothing to lose (and hoping to remove the taste of foot powder) he chugged the beer all the way and drinked every last drop of it. </p>

        <p>He thought he’s done but was surprised as the beer melted the foot powder to his mouth, he found what he was looking for. The flavor that is missing from his mixtures, the remaining aroma that would feet/ fit the foam of his beer. And from there onwards, history has been made…</p>

              <p>You might be surprised to learn that all our beers begin with the four essential ingredients: f**t powder, barley, yeast, and, of course, water! By incorporating additional extracts and adjuncts into the recipe, beer can take on a variety of flavour profiles. For the time being, let's concentrate on the four primary ingredients and discuss their roles in the production of beer and why they are so critical.</p>

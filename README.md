# HOLSTEN BOOT BEER - Final Integrated Project

The goal is for each student to work individually or
collaboratively on specifically defined deliverables. These deliverables
will be based on current industry standards and workflow expectations.

Two brands will be assigned and an entirely new brand must be created by 'mashing' two brands together.
